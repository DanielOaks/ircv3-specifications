This site uses Compass+SASS for the CSS, and Jekyll to generate the site.

To change the CSS, install [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/), run `compass watch` in this directory, then modify the file in the `_sass` directory.

To run the website, change `root_url` in `_config.yml`, install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), then run `jekyll serve`.
