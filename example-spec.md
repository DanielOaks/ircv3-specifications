<!--
This is an example specification, which is intended to help you while writing a new proposal!

Feel free to use this as a rough guideline while writing up your specification. However,
keep in mind that the sections here are not set in stone and are just intended to be a
useful guide.

Also take a look at other specifications and the CONTRIBUTING.md file for further
suggestions and information to keep in mind while writing a proposal.

## Introduction

This feature is intended to solve problem A, or provide a new feature B.

We've written this specification because of C.

<!--
In other words, a rough overview of why the spec exists, the new features you're trying to
provide and/or the issues you're trying to solve. In other words, why other people should be
motivated to implement it, and why you have been motivated to write it.
-->

## Architecture

This specification introduces various capabilities, messages, numerics and tokens as
necessary. This section (and subsections) describe exactly how those work, and define those
new or extended caps/messages/numerics/tokens.

<!--
A detailed description of the feature which this specification describes.
The following sections may be useful to present, as necessary:

### Capabilities
### Messages
### Numerics
### RPL_ISUPPORT Tokens
### Examples
-->

## Security Considerations

New features may have security-specific considerations that authors should take note of
while implementing your specification. This section lists those considerations in one place,
so they can look over them.

If no security considerations exist, you should include this text instead:

There are no security considerations that implementations should note when implementing this
specification.

## Alternatives

Sometimes, specifications have alternate solutions already out there and being used, or
there are alternate proposals which cover roughly the same features and fixes. This section
can be used to list those alternate proposals and features, note why they have not been used
instead, and why this spec is better than them.

In a large number of cases, this section can be ommitted.
